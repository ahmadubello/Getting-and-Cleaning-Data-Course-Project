# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

## This project contains the following files:

1.An R script named run_analysis.R  
2.A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md  
3.A tidy dataset tidy_data.txt produced by the run_analysis.R following the steps listed below:

## The run_analysis.R script performs the following tasks:
1.merges the train and test data sets to create a single data set.    
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.    
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.       
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.    
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
